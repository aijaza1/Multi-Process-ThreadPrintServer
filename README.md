# Multi-Process-ThreadPrintServer

Developed a C program that simulated a dynamic print server using both processes and threads. The project's core aim was to exemplify synchronization and coordination through semaphores in a multi-producer, multi-consumer scenario. The program efficiently managed printer job requests in a shared queue, with producer processes adding jobs and consumer threads processing them. The project demonstrated practical implementation of synchronization mechanisms and included features like interactive command-line initiation and proper resource cleanup upon termination. It was a hands-on exploration of concurrent programming, showcasing my ability to manage intricate interactions and synchronization challenges in such environments.
